# ElxGist

This project was made so i could study elixir and pheonix, i was following this tutorial (for the most part): https://youtu.be/OMKugMwRrko?si=zMDOSnZAWTAbM8rj
Since the series is not finished yet, i will add my own solution to some problems. I'm very new to elixir so it will probably be
really ugly.
